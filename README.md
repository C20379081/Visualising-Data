### Big Idea : Navigating Real Estate for First-Time Buyers and people emigrating to the USA: What should really be considered when buying a property in a new location?
This Big Idea is about equipping first-time home buyers and people who may be emigrating to the USA with the knowledge to make the correct decisions for them in the real estate market.
The idea is to present them with the necessary information about the property prices and factors that affect the price such as average household income and quality of life factors such as climate and cost of living. 
To choose the ideal location in America to relocate or buy their first home.


The dashboard shows the various factors which can aid a person decision on where to move to in the USA and points out some of the most important considerations when moving locations. It also is ideal for first time buyers who are unsure of where they fit in comparison to other people on the property ladder. This dashboard allows them to make informed decisions based on their preferences, buy within their means, and helps them to get the most out of what they have.
The weather chart enables the person to identify which locations they would completely rule out, such as Minneapolis due to its extreme winters or Phoenix because of its extreme summers. They may be looking for somewhere like Miami and Los Angeles where its relatively warm year-round and this visualisation will guide this decision- making process.
The **Property/Income scatter plot** enables the person to see roughly what value property they will be aiming for using their household income. The trendline makes it easy to trace what value of property they will be looking to obtain.
Using the discovery from the previous graph, the person can then see roughly what city they would be aiming to buy in, when considering the climate as well as the average property price in that location they should be able to narrow down the options.
Lastly, once the person has decided on a few locations, they can browse the **map** and see what is on offer in the various locations, the map will provide various information about the property which could contribute to their overall decision.
